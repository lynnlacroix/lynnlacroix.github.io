I am a PhD student in the Critical Disability Studies department at York University. I am also a co-organiser of Les Nocturnes, a grassroots crisis response group based in Tiohtià:ke (Montréal), and am allied with the advocacy groups Voices For Unhoused Liberation and the Trinity Community Hub in Tkaronto (Toronto).
